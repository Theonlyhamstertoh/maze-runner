# Maze Runner

The goal of this project is to create a infinite maze game where you, the player, will move around in a limited time to complete as many maze you possibly can. Each maze will start small, 3x3, and progressively increase as you solve each maze. 



## Core Steps to Complete 
- [x] Generate a maze 
- [x] Maze walls should have random color generation
- [x] Maze should increase in size as player progress
- [x] A flag should be at the goal of the maze
- [x] Add physics to the walls
- [x] Add physics to the player
- [x] Create player movement
- [x] Create a maze level system 
- [x] Different Maze Design on certain levels. For example, skinny row, long column.


## Reflection
This project was definitely a bigger project I have tackle on. As you can see from below, I was very ambitious with this project. I am happy that I got the base of the game finished even if not the fullest result I wish to have. The maze algorithm generation was a really fun task and was quite fulfilling to finally see it working in 3d on the web displayed. Overall, the project is finished and I did not give up half way. That makes me happy. Onto the next!

## Ideas
- [ ] split screen two players or 4? 
- [ ] Add leaderboard system with firebase?
- [ ] Maybe the start of the game can be a pre-generated blender gladitor map look and user fall down through a hole to the start of game
- [ ] Add algorithm to find furthest path position from player for goal 
- [ ] When timer reach 0, make user fall down to a smaller maze and repeat until time is over.
- [ ] Each level should play music.
- [ ] Sync audio to the maze walls. 
- [ ] Sync audio to the player. 
- [ ] Sync audio to the rotation speed of maze.
- [ ] Maze wall should change in color.
- [ ] Add wind in the game.
- [ ] A hole should also be at the goal of the maze 
- [ ] Player after completing first maze should drop down to next maze through hole
- [ ] Maze should rotate on certain level to add difficulty
- [ ] A 30 second timer at beginning. 
- [ ] When timer reach 0, game over 
- [ ] Use maze level as points
- [ ] Create death traps that ends the game
- [ ] Maze rotate completely 90 degrees to have gravity affect the player and make it difficult. 
- [ ] Multiple camera views: MapMode, FollowMode, FirstPersonMode
- [ ] Sliding walls that act as obstacles
- [ ] User should input their name at start
- [ ] User name tag should be visible above player object
- [ ] Show user path trail with line (and overlapping line should get darker)
