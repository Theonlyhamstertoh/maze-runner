# Maze Runner

The goal of this project is to create a infinite maze game where you, the player, will move around in a limited time to complete as many maze you possibly can. Each maze will start small, 3x3, and progressively increase as you solve each maze. 

## Core Steps to Complete 
- [x] Generate a maze 
- [ ] Maze walls should have a glassy appearance
- [ ] Maze should increase in size as player progress
- [ ] A flag should be at the goal of the maze
- [ ] A hole should also be at the goal of the maze 
- [ ] Player after completing first maze should drop down to next maze through hole
- [ ] Maze should rotate on certain level to add difficulty
- [ ] Add physics to the walls
- [ ] Add physics to the player
- [ ] Create player movement
- [ ] A 30 second timer at beginning. 
- [ ] When timer reach 0, game over 
- [ ] Use maze level as points
- [ ] Create a maze level system 
- [ ] Create death traps that ends the game
- [ ] Maze rotate completely 90 degrees to have gravity affect the player and make it difficult. 
- [ ] Multiple camera views: MapMode, FollowMode, FirstPersonMode
- [ ] Sliding walls that act as obstacles
- [ ] User should input their name at start
- [ ] User name tag should be visible above player object
- [ ] Different Maze Design on certain levels. For example, skinny row, long column.
- [] Show user path trail with line (and overlapping line should get darker)


## Ideas
- [ ] split screen two players or 4? 
- [ ] Add leaderboard system with firebase?
- [ ] Maybe the start of the game can be a pre-generated blender gladitor map look and user fall down through a hole to the start of game
- [ ] Add algorithm to find furthest path position from player for goal 
- [ ] When timer reach 0, make user fall down to a smaller maze and repeat until time is over.
- [ ] Each level should play music.
- [ ] Sync audio to the maze walls. 
- [ ] Sync audio to the player. 
- [ ] Sync audio to the rotation speed of maze.
- [ ] Maze wall should change in color.
- [ ] Add wind in the game.
